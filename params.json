{"name":"xGhosts","tagline":"Call of Duty Ghosts Web Interface","body":"# The xGhost Project - v. Alpha\r\n\r\nThe xGhost Project has been developed for those Call of Duty Ghosts' player that, for many reasons, doesn't feel good with the provided apps:\r\n\r\n* [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/call-of-duty/id733712309)\r\n* [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.activision.callofduty.mobile)\r\n* [Windows 8](http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/call-of-duty/1fa9f76d-41de-40e6-bb04-8ee90182c1b9)\r\n\r\nFor example, in my clan there are some players that:\r\n\r\n- don't have a smartphone or a tablet\r\n- have a Windows Phone whose version is not supported\r\n- (like me) have an old, slow smartphone\r\n\r\nand that get even more frustrating!\r\nWhen doing Clan Wars, leaders get spammed by teammates by questions such as \"What's our rank?\" or \"Who should we attack next?\".\r\n\r\nFor some unknown reasons there was still no Web App to provide those useful informations and, since I am a web developer, I decided to change that by making  that Web App on my own and by sharing it with the community!\r\n\r\nWhat's cool about xGhost? xGhost it's responsive so it has no device restriction, it should adapt to kinda every resolution and it's 10x faster than the app! You can use with every smartphone, computer and tablet, you could even check your clan war status with the washing machine if it has a browser and trust me one day it will have a browser!!\r\n![xghost showcase](http://oi57.tinypic.com/29yjl6w.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Alpha version\r\n\r\nxGhost is under development so it still poor and bugged but it should be helpfull, i rushed the alpha release due to the incoming war but i'm already studying a new stunning layout and features to add!
